        <p>Hello world! This is HTML5Base.</p>

        <p>This project will do lots of things for you - it will separate your development files (_src) from your testing files (_dist), allow for simple Javascript hinting, file concatenation, HTML includes, SASS compilation, and much more. Forget about wasting time bootstrapping projects yourself.</p>

        <p>This project leverages the following projects for internet awesomeness:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>HTML5 Boilerplate</li>
          <li>Node.js</li>
          <li>Grunt</li>
          <li>Sass</li>
          <li>Compass</li>
          <li>JSHint</li>
        </ul>
